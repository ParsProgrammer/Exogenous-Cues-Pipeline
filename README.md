## ðŸ“– Introduction [(SoMe4Dem)](https://some4dem.eu/consortium)
Democracy in the 21st century is facing challenges, with the **public sphere** â€” the space for political discussion â€” changing in concerning ways. Social media plays a dual role:

- **Positive:** Platforms like Twitter/X and Facebook make political debate more open and accessible.  
- **Negative:** They create echo chambers, fragment discussion, weaken civil debate norms, and reduce trust in institutions.  

This project addresses the issue from three perspectives:
1. Collecting stronger evidence about how social media affects political debates and society.  
2. Understanding the mechanisms behind these effects.  
3. Developing tools to help social media better support democracy â€” improving debate, building legitimacy, and strengthening democratic citizenship.

## ðŸ§© The Problem
Social media platforms rely on **engagement-driven recommender systems**, usually powered by collaborative filtering. These systems:
- Maximize clicks, likes, and shares rather than information quality.  
- Promote misinformation, gossip, or sensational content as effectively as fact-based reporting.  

Filtering content directly for quality is computationally expensive, difficult to scale, and raises censorship concerns.  

âœ… **Our alternative:** Use **exogenous cues** (contextual signals) as proxies for information quality.  
Example: A news domain with a politically diverse audience is more likely to be reliable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Our research is structured into two main phases:  

### Phase 1 â€” Identifying Useful Exogenous Cues
We tested several cues against **NewsGuard** scores (0â€“100 reliability ratings by professional journalists).  
Cues that showed significant correlation with NewsGuard ratings were retained as predictors.

Explored exogenous cues:
- Political diversity of a domainâ€™s broadcasters  
- Popularity of domains  
- Skewness of broadcaster distribution  
- Skewness of article distribution  
- Cognitive centrality of domains (multiple variants)

### Phase 2 â€” Building an Augmented Recommender System
We integrated the strongest cues into standard recommendation algorithms to create an **augmented model**.  
This approach improves recommendation quality without directly filtering or censoring content.  

Datasets:
- Twitter/X data from the **US** and **Germany**  
- Included usersâ€™ partisanship, allowing analysis of how domains spread across the political spectrum

## ðŸ“Š Modeling & Results
We framed prediction as a **regression task**: estimating NewsGuard scores from contextual cues.  

Models used:
- **Random Forest** â†’ captured non-linear relationships, robust against noisy signals  
- **Elastic Net** â†’ interpretable, identified the most relevant features while reducing redundancy

### Key insights:
- Random Forest achieved strong predictive performance.  
- Elastic Net revealed which contextual cues most consistently influenced information quality.  
- Together, they balanced **accuracy and interpretability**.  

### Explainability:
